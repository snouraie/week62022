## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(knitr)
library(gridExtra)
library(GGally)
library(kableExtra)
library(jtools)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
derby.df <- read.csv("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofPittsburgh/derby.csv")
derby.df <- derby.df %>%
  mutate( fast = ifelse(condition=="fast",1,0), 
          good = ifelse(condition=="good",1,0),
          yearnew = year - 1896,
          fastfactor = ifelse(fast == 0, "not fast", "fast"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
